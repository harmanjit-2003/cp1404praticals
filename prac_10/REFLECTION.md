Estimates for Practical Tasks:

My initial estimates for completing practical tasks were often optimistic, reflecting a common challenge among beginners in overestimating their familiarity with the subject matter. As the course progressed, I learned to better account for potential setbacks and the iterative nature of problem-solving, which improved the accuracy of my estimates. This was a valuable lesson in project management, underscoring the importance of adaptability and realistic planning in the learning process.

Code Reviews:

Participating in code reviews was a multifaceted learning experience. When my code was under review, I learned to embrace constructive criticism and recognize it as an opportunity for growth. Reviewing others' code, on the other hand, honed my attention to detail and deepened my understanding of best practices in coding. Both roles taught me the significance of clear communication and the collaborative effort required to elevate the quality of work within a team.

Practical Tasks Overall:

If given the authority to make changes to the subject, I would incorporate more real-world scenarios into the practical tasks to bridge the gap between academic exercises and industry expectations. I would also encourage peer-to-peer learning opportunities, as collaborative problem-solving often yields innovative solutions and strengthens the learning community. Finally, I would implement a feedback loop where students can suggest modifications to the curriculum, ensuring that the subject remains dynamic and responsive to student needs.
